AGE GROUP AND LIFE TIME VALUE
PURPOSE - The purpose of age groups is to identify which age segment uses products the most and which shows less interest - 28-30 age group spends highest (₹1,99,900) meaning they love the products, while 22-24 spends lowest (₹16,100) indicating less interest. This helps businesses target marketing to the right age group.
